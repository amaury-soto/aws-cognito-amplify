# Test concept Login flow with AWS-COGNITO-AMPLIFY

The idea of this proof of concept is to develop a react native mobile app that does all the normal login flow of an app, consuming aws services, such as cognito and amplify. 
With this we can simulate a flow similar to the one used today by TaDa Delivery. 


## Flow scenarios
- signIn
- signUp
- confirmSignUp
- forgotPassword
- changePassword
- External login with social media provider, in this case Google
